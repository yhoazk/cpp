# Structs and Classes

In C++ structs and classes are somewhat alike, it is possible to 
add a  `()` operator to a struct


## Structs and classes differences in C++

Structs have all their members, and bases public classes have them private
by default.

Both classes and structs can modify the access to their members to `private`,
`protected` or `public` also both can use inheritance and can have member
functions.

## Example:
